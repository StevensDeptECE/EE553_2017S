Project code should be:

1. well documented
   class should be commented
   one line explain what the class represents

   every method should be explained.  What does it do?

   DON"T: explaining c++

   x++; // add one to x  // WHY??????

   DO: explain your logic

2. Clean, object-oriented code

Your presentation should describe the architecture of how the code works
NOT EVERY LINE

10 minute time limit.

Manage your time.

Really good idea to end with demo
if you do the demo, then do the architecture, boring!

First explain, make sure you don't run out of time
Demo


Points
	Clarity
	not everyone obligated to present
	Difficulty of design
	Code Working

	What isn't in the repo DOES NOT EXIST
	

Presentations:
	Don't drive the demo/powerpoint and talk
	Don't look backwards!!!
	At least look at the laptop.
	Try to rehearse
